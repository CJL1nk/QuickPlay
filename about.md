# QuickPlay

QuickPlay is a mod that lets you save 2 levels to the main menu screen of your game

Upon clicking one of them, the level immediately opens so you can get straight into practicing

MY idea behind it is to save the main copy of the level you're playing and a startpos copy, but use it however you like
